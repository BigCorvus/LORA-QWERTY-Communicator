# LORA-QWERTY-Communicator
A tidy and feature-packed LORA QWERTY communication device mainly based on a Blackberry Q10 keyboard, nRF52840, SX1262 and a 2.7'' Sharp Memory LCD (LS027B7DH01).
I created this because I wanted to practice a little and put some components that I had laying around to good use. 
The repository contains the EAGLE PCB design files, gerber files for JLCPCB, Solidworks design files and .STL for a perfectly fitting enclosure and an Arduino test sketch to test most of the system components.
While the hardware is quite nice and confirmed working, the firmware part is very raw and has yet to be developed. Unfortunately I lack time desperately for such things at the moment. What I had in mind for this device is mainly something like an encrypted LORA communicator, maybe eben based on Meshtastic. It can also communicate with other BLE devices and acquire, log and share sensor data or act as a USB or BLE HID keyboard.
